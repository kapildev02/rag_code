**Question: explain me the structure of kidney?**

I'll help explain the structure of the kidney following the provided framework.

**Introduction:**
The kidney is a vital organ with complex anatomical organization that enables its crucial functions of filtration, reabsorption, and maintenance of homeostasis. Understanding its structure is fundamental for comprehending renal pathology and interpreting radiological findings.

**Core Explanation:**

**1. Gross Anatomy:**
- The kidney has three distinct regions visible on coronal section:
  * Outer brownish cortex
  * Inner pale medulla
  * Renal sinus (central space)
- Surrounded by protective layers:
  * Perirenal fat (in Gerota's space)
  * Renal fascia (Gerota's fascia) with anterior (Toldt) and posterior (Zuckerkandl) layers
  * Pararenal fat

**2. Internal Architecture:**
- Contains 1-3 million uriniferous tubules composed of:
  * Collecting tubules (collecting system)
  * Nephrons (secretory units)
- Collecting System:
  * Renal pelvis
  * 2-3 major calyces
  * 7-13 minor calyces

**3. Blood Supply:**
- Renal artery originates from aorta at L1-L2 vertebral level
- Divides into anterior and posterior divisions
- Forms five segments: apical, upper, middle, lower, and posterior
- Features Brödel's avascular plane (clinically significant)

**Study Guidance:**
- Focus on segmental anatomy for surgical applications
- Remember the layered arrangement from inside out
- Understand the relationship between blood supply and anatomical segments

**Clinical Applications:**
1. Surgical Planning: Knowledge of segmental anatomy is crucial for partial nephrectomy and nephron-sparing surgery
2. Vascular Considerations: Understanding Brödel's avascular plane is essential for anatrophic nephrolithotomy

**Clinical Pearls:**
- 95% of abdominal aortic aneurysms occur below renal artery origin
- The segmental blood supply allows for selective surgical approaches
- The collecting system arrangement explains patterns of stone formation and obstruction

**Summary:**
• Kidney has three distinct zones: cortex, medulla, and renal sinus
• Contains millions of nephrons organized into segments
• Blood supply determines surgical approaches
• Collecting system has hierarchical organization

**Thought Question:**
How does the understanding of renal segmental anatomy influence surgical decision-making in partial nephrectomy?

The knowledge of renal anatomy is critical for:
1. Surgical planning
2. Interpreting radiological studies
3. Understanding pathological processes
4. Managing urological conditions
